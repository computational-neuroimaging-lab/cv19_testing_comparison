## Who can participate?
Anyone 18 years or older can participate as long as 1) you own an iPhone or Android smartphone, and 2) you have periodic access to a good wifi connection. 

___

## What will the study involve? 
There will be two main components:

1) At the beginning of the study you will complete some questionnaires to give us a better sense of your current state of mind and living situation and how it’s changed since COVID-19 started influencing daily life. There will also be a wrap-up questionnaire at the end.

2) You will download a specially created, secure research app to your smartphone. This app will collect data from some of the sensors on your smartphone to provide information about your patterns of activity, mobility, and social behaviors. It will also send you a set of brief questions 2-3 times per day, asking about your sleep, COVID-19 symptoms (if any), moods, levels of stress, etc.; the surveys take 1-2 mins to complete. You can learn more about the full set of sensors and questions asked here. 

___

## Why should I participate?

First, you will be helping scientists gather vital information about the behavioral and psychological responses to this pandemic and others that might come. These findings will rapidly be published so that scientists and policy makers can devise interventions and strategies to aid our social, psychological, and economic recovery and our future crisis preparation.

Second, we believe it will be interesting and informative for you. This exercise was originally developed as one of the writing assignments for an introductory psychology course at the University of Texas at Austin in the 2018-19 school year (but without the coronavirus part, obviously). So, it was designed with educational objectives in mind. Specifically, you will receive weekly feedback charting the trajectories of your moods, stress, activity, mobility, and socialization patterns. In the past, students have found this information to be exceptionally informative and, in many cases, surprising. Our students found it particularly interesting (and in some cases alarming!) to see objective indicators of their own behaviors (e.g., how often they checked their phones). You can see some sample graphs from previous years here.
Third, University of Texas students who seek to fulfill their research requirement will be able to get experimental credit (see below).


## I am an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. Can I get experimental requirement credit?
Yes, those University of Texas at Austin students who still need to fulfill their research requirement will be able to get 3 hours of experimental credit through the Department of Psychology’s SONA system. On SONA, enroll in the study called “Behavioral & Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A SmartPhone Sensing Study.” You will be awarded all 3 credit hours after you have downloaded the smartphone sensing app and kept it on your phone for one full week. For questions about research credit and navigating SONA, please see this FAQ or email psyresearch@austin.utexas.edu. You can still participate in the study even if you do not want or need research credit.


## Can I drop out of the study once it has started?
Yes, you can drop out at any time without consequence. 


## How is this study better than others?
There are many studies about COVID-19 underway at the moment but virtually all of them rely on people retrospectively reporting on their behaviors. Ours is different in two important ways: 1) Our app allows us to capture actual behaviors, not just reports of behaviors that are so susceptible to biases (e.g. memory lapses, misreporting).
2) Our automated sampling of behavior permits data collection at a level of granularity and richness not possible in other studies.

___

## Will my data be safe?
Yes, we have a great deal of experience collecting data like this and keeping it secure. Since 2013, our research team has been conducting smartphone-based sensing studies that have enrolled thousands of participants. We use sophisticated data encryption, and the data are securely stored on university-owned servers at the University of Texas at Austin. Furthermore, the data are not associated with your name or student EID. All analyses and publications are done on aggregated data only. The data we collect will only be used for research purposes and will only be accessible to members of the research team. We will not share or sell any data to third parties. The study has been approved by the University of Texas Institutional Review Board (IRB #2018-07-0035).

___

## How long will the study last? 

That’s a hard question to answer. Initially, we are aiming for a three week study. However, we may try to extend it depending on how the pandemic develops. We would really appreciate you taking part in it for as long as you can. You will continue to get feedback for as long as you remain in the study.

## If I know others who would like to be involved, can they join the study too? 

Yes. Simply share this doc on social media, email it to a friend, or ask them to email us at utcovid19study@austin.utexas.edu.

## How do I enroll in the study?

Please follow this link to start the first step of the study. If you are a University of Texas at Austin student who seeking research credit for your participation, please find the study and enroll in it on SONA.
