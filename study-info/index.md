## What will the study involve? 
There will be two main components:

1) In addition to the standard swab test you're receiving today, you will give a saliva test. The results of both of these tests will be provided to you after they are processed.

2) You will answer a few survey questions about your personal medical history and family's medical history.

## Why should I participate?

You will be helping scientists compare and validate the different ways of giving COVID-19 tests. These findings will contribute to the general knowledge that medical professionals have about these tests, and will provide valuable information on which types of tests are best to use moving forward. It also may be beneficial for you to see results from more than one test, to reduce the chance of a false-positive or false-negative.
